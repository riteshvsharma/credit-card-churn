    "Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card, credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others. Some fees are charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas\n",
    "\n",
    "You as a Data scientist at Thera bank need to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to identify the best possible model that will give the required performance\n",

    "Build a classification model to predict if the customer is going to churn or not\n",
    "Optimize the model using appropriate techniques\n",
    "Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the bank\n",
    "Data Dictionary:\n",

    "Best Practices for Notebook : \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.\n",
    "The notebook should be run from start to finish sequentially before submission.\n",
    "It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Submission Guidelines :\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission should be: well commented Jupyter notebook [format - .HTML] - Please run the notebook sequentially before submitting.\n",
    "Any assignment found copied/ plagiarized with other groups will not be graded and awarded zero marks\n",
    "Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will not be accepted for evaluation\n",
    "Submission will not be evaluated if,\n",
    "it is submitted post-deadline, or,\n",
    "more than 1 files are submitted\n",
